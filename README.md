# Play Overview

The following section will teach you the mechanics for playing through an individual scenario, using the first one in the Scenario Book, **Black Barrow**, as an example.

**Standard Attack Modifier Deck**

![Standard attack modifier deck](img/rulebook/standard-attack-modifier-deck.png)

### THE PLAY AREA INCLUDES:

![Play area](img/rulebook/play-area.png)

- A modular board of map tiles (a), constructed in a specific configuration using the Scenario Book as a reference (see Scenario Setup on pp. 12–13 for details). The map tiles should be laid out with doors (b) connecting them. The configuration of overlay tiles and monsters for the first room (c) should also be set up along with the character figures.
- A character mat for each player (d) and the corresponding hand of ability cards for that character’s class (e), health and experience trackers (f), character tokens (g), a facedown battle goal card (h), and any equipped item cards (i).
- All monster statistic cards (j), with their corresponding standees, and monster ability cards (k) set to one side in individual shuffled decks.
- Shuffled decks of attack modifier cards for each player (l) and one for the monsters (m). **A standard attack modifier deck consists of twenty cards as shown at the top of the page**, not the characterspecific modifier cards found in the character boxes. A deck, however, may be modified by level-up bonuses, items, scenario effects, and the effects of the CURSE and BLESS conditions.
- Piles of damage tokens (n), money tokens (o), and condition tokens (p).
- The elemental infusion table (q) with all six elements set in the “Inert” column.

## Character Mats

When a player begins their journey with the game, he or she will select one of the available character classes to play. Only one copy of each character class can be played in any given scenario. Each class has a unique set of abilities, so this is an important decision to make. When the box is first opened, the Brute ![Brute](img/icons/class/01.png), Tinkerer ![Brute](img/icons/class/02.png), Spellweaver ![Brute](img/icons/class/03.png), Scoundrel ![Brute](img/icons/class/04.png), Cragheart ![Brute](img/icons/class/05.png), and Mindthief ![Brute](img/icons/class/06.png) are available.

Once a character class has been chosen, the player takes the corresponding character mat, character tokens, and that character’s starting hand of Level 1 ability cards from the larger tuck box containing the character’s symbol, as well as the miniature contained in the smaller character tuck box.

### A CHARACTER MAT INCLUDES:

![Character mat and tracking dial](img/rulebook/character-mat.png)

- A portrait (a), icon (b), and name (c) of the class.
- Indicators of the maximum hit points at each level (d) of the class. Players should use tracking dials (e) to track their hit points (f) and experience (g) during a scenario.
- The maximum number of ability cards the class can take into battle (h).
- A short reference (i) for the round structure.
- Designations along the border (j) for where to place **discarded**, **lost**, and **active** cards.
- The reference number of the event cards (k) added to each deck when the character class is unlocked (not present on the six starting classes) and of event cards (l) added the first time the character class retires (see Announcing Retirement on p. 48 for details). These reference numbers apply to both city and road event decks.

## Character Ability Cards

Playing ability cards is what allows a character to perform **actions** in a scenario. Each round players choose two ability cards and use the **top action** of one card and the **bottom action** of the other card, resulting in two **actions** for each player on his or her turn. All ability cards are specific to a character class and are acquired when starting a new character or by leveling up.

### AN ABILITY CARD INCLUDES:

![Ability card](img/rulebook/ability-card.png)

- The name of the ability (a).
- An initiative number (b). The initiative number of the leading card played determines a player’s order in the initiative of a given round (see Determining Initiative on p. 18 for more details).
- The level of the class card (c). A character starting at Level 1 can only use their Level 1 cards (or, alternately, Level X cards), but a character gains more powerful cards as they level up to add to their pool of available ability cards.
- A top action (d) and bottom action (e). When the two ability cards are played on a player’s turn, one is used for the top action and the other for the bottom action. Note that a single **action** can contain several separate **abilities** (f). (See Character Turn on pp. 18–28 for more details on character actions.)

**<p align="right">Page 8</p>**

---

## Item Cards

Item cards are acquired by spending gold in between scenarios or looting specific treasure tiles. All item cards a character equips will be placed below his or her character mat and can be used during a battle to augment his or her abilities. Item cards are not class-specific, so any character can use any item. However, characters are limited in the number of items they can **equip** (bring into a scenario). Each character can equip only one ![Head item](img/icons/items/head.png) item, one ![Body item](img/icons/items/body.png) item, one ![Legs item](img/icons/items/legs.png) item, up to two ![Two Hands item](img/icons/items/two-hands.png) items **OR** one ![One Hand item](img/icons/items/one-hand.png) item, and up to a number of ![Small item](img/icons/items/small-item.png) equal to half their level, rounded up. **Characters cannot own more than one copy of any item card.**

![Head item](img/icons/items/large/head.png) | ![Body item](img/icons/items/large/body.png) | ![Legs item](img/icons/items/large/legs.png) | ![Two Hands item](img/icons/items/large/two-hands.png) | ![One Hand item](img/icons/items/large/one-hand.png) | ![Small item](img/icons/items/large/small-item.png)
-----|------|------|----------|-----------|-----------
Head | Body | Legs | One Hand | Two Hands | Small Item

### AN ITEM CARD INCLUDES:

![Item card](img/rulebook/item-card.png)

- The name of the item (a) and the amount of gold a character must pay to acquire the item from the shop (b).
- What happens to the card after it is used (c). 
  - This symbol ![Spend](img/icons/general/spend.png) means the item is **spent** after use, which is denoted by rotating the card to its side. Spent cards can be refreshed when a character performs a long rest (see Resting on p. 17 for more details). Sometimes an item is used multiple times before it is spent or consumed. This is depicted by use slots (d) on the card and can be tracked using a character token. 
  - This symbol ![Consume](img/icons/general/loss.png) (not pictured) means the item is **consumed** after use, which is shown by flipping the card facedown. Consumed cards can only be refreshed **during a scenario** by specific abilities. **All items are refreshed between scenarios.** No item can be permanently consumed. 
  - If a card depicts neither of these symbols, there are no restrictions on the number of times it can be used during a scenario, other than what is written in the text of the card.
- When the item can be used and the bonus gained by the character when the item card is used (e).
- The equip slot (Head, Body, Legs, One Hand, Two Hands, Small Item) the item occupies (f).
- Some equipped items add a number of ![Penalty attack modifier cards](img/misc/penalty-card.png) cards to the equipping character’s attack modifier deck at the start of a scenario. If this is the case, the number of modifier cards is specified on the item (g).
- A count of how many of this item are in the game (h) and where this card lies within that count (i).
- Reference number for the item (j), which is on the back of the card.

## Monster Statistics Cards

Monster statistic cards give easy access to the base statistics of a given monster type for both its normal and elite variants. A monster’s base statistics will vary depending on the **scenario level** (see Scenario Level on p. 15 for details). Each edge of the cards, on both sides, reflects the statistics for a given scenario level. Rotate or flip the card to show the required level.

A monster stat sleeve should be used to track damage and condition tokens and to hide the unneeded information for other unused levels.

### A MONSTER STATISTIC CARD INCLUDES:

![Monster Statistics Card](img/rulebook/monster-stat-card.png)

- The monster’s name (a) and level of the statistic set (b) corresponding to the scenario level.
- Sections for normal (c) and elite (d) versions of this monster.
- A monster’s **hit point** value (e), which is the amount of damage that needs to be inflicted on the monster before it dies.
- A monster’s **movement** value (f), the base number of hexes a monster can move with a **Move** action.
- A monster’s **attack** value (g), the base amount of damage the monster does with an **Attack** action.
- A monster’s **range** value (h), which is the base number of hexes away from the monster’s own hex that the monster can reach with an attack or a heal. A “–” as the range value signifies the monster’s normal **Attack** action can only target adjacent hexes (i.e., a **melee** attack).
- Any special traits this monster type possesses (i). These traits are permanent and persist from round to round. These traits may include Flying, which is symbolized by ![Flying](img/icons/general/flying.png) (j) next to the monster’s name (see Move on p. 19 for details).

**<p align="right">Page 10</p>**

---

## Monster Ability Cards

Each round, after players have selected their own ability cards, one card is played for each monster type currently on the board from their respective decks of monster ability cards. These cards determine which abilities each monster of that type—both normal and elite—will perform during the round on its turn.

### A MONSTER ABILITY CARD INCLUDES:

![Monster Ability Card](img/rulebook/monster-ability-card.png)

- The name of the monster type (a). Sometimes, multiple monster types use the same, more generic ability deck. For instance, Bandit Guards, City Guards, and Inox Guards all use the same “Guard” deck.
- An initiative number (b). This number will determine when every monster of that type will act in a given round (see Determining Initiative on p. 18 for details).
- A list of abilities (c). A monster will perform each of these abilities in the order listed (if possible) and then end its turn (see Monster Turn on pp. 29–32 for details).
- A shuffle symbol (d). If this symbol appears on a card, shuffle the corresponding monster’s ability discard pile back into the draw deck at the end of the round.

## Battle Goal Cards

![Battle Goal Card](img/rulebook/battle-goal-card.png)

**At the beginning of every scenario, each character receives two battle goal cards in secret and chooses one to keep, discarding the other.** If the scenario is successfully completed and the character meets the criteria of the chosen card (a), he or she will earn a number of **checkmarks** as specified on the bottom of the card (b). Checkmarks are used to enhance a player’s attack modifier deck (see Additional Perks on p. 44 for details). If the scenario resulted in failure, the character receives nothing from his or her battle goal card, regardless of whether the goal was achieved. Players can keep track of their battle goal progress using notes if necessary. Players should keep their battle goals secret from one another until the scenario is over.

---
**<p align="right">Page 11</p>**

---

## Attack Modifier Cards

Any time an **Attack** ability is performed, a separate attack modifier card is drawn for **each individual target** of the attack. Players draw from the personal attack modifier deck for their chosen character and monsters draw from a collective monster deck. The modifier listed on the card is then applied to the attack, possibly reducing or increasing its numerical value.

### AN ATTACK MODIFIER CARD INCLUDES:

![Attack Modifier Cards](img/rulebook/attack-modifier-cards.png)

The value of the modifier for the attack (a). A “Null” symbol (b) means that no damage is done by the attack. A “2x” symbol (c) means the attack value is doubled.

Conditions, elemental infusions, or other special effects of the attack (d). If the attack modifier of the card is +0, the special effect is shown in the center circle of the card (e). Otherwise, it is shown to the left of the modifier value (f). When these special effects are activated, they function exactly as if they had been written on the action card being used for the attack.

![Rolling Modifier Card](img/rulebook/rolling-modifier-card.png)

A rolling modifier symbol (g) indicates that an additional modifier card should be drawn. Modifier cards are then drawn until a rolling modifier is **not** revealed, at which point all the drawn modifiers are added together.

![Rolling Modifier Example](img/rulebook/rolling-modifier-example.png)  
*Add “PUSH 2” and the earth element effects to your attack, then increase y our attack value by 2.*

![BLESS and CURSE cards](img/rulebook/bless-curse-cards.png)

A special BLESS (h) or CURSE (i) border. If a BLESS or CURSE card is drawn, it should be **removed** from the player’s deck instead of being placed into the discard. Curse cards also have either a ![Monster icon](img/misc/monster.png) or an ![Star icon](img/misc/star.png) to denote whether they can be placed in the monster attack modifier deck ![Monster icon](img/misc/monster.png), or a character's attack modifier deck ![Star icon](img/misc/star.png).

![Shuffle symbol](img/rulebook/shuffle.png)

A shuffle symbol (j). At the end of the round in which a “Null” ![Null card](img/misc/null-card.png) or “2x” ![2x card](img/misc/2x-card.png) card is drawn from a deck, players will shuffle all the played modifier cards back into that particular draw deck. This shuffling also happens if a modifier card must be drawn and there are none left in the draw pile.

![Modifier type icons](img/rulebook/modifier-type-icons.png)

A type icon (k). All standard attack modifier decks have a 1, 2, 3, 4, or M icon (l) for easy sorting, such that all cards with a given icon form the standard 20-card deck. All cards a character class adds to their modifier decks through perks (see Leveling Up on pp. 44–45 for details) have the symbol of that character class (m). Cards added to a modifier deck by a scenario or item effect have a ![Star icon](img/misc/star.png) icon (n). These cards should be removed at the end of a scenario.

# Scenario Setup

When setting up a new scenario, the first step is to look in the scenario book to set up the map tiles and prepare all the monster types you will be fighting. Then read the introduction text and apply any negative scenario effects from the “Special Rules” section. Next, two battle goals should be dealt to each player, one of which will be discarded. Players can then decide which items they would like to equip from the collection of items they own (adding in -1 cards to their attack modifier decks when applicable). Next, players should decide which ability cards they would like to put in their hand, choosing from the pool of those available to them. A player must select a number of cards equal to his or her character’s hand size. When first starting the game, a player’s hand should only consist of the set of **Level 1** ability cards for the character’s class. Once a player has become familiar with the class, he or she can begin substituting out Level 1 cards for the more complex cards with **X** as the level. Once the character begins to level up, he or she will also get access to higher level cards to add to his or her hand by pulling others out. After players select their hand, any effects of a preceding road event or city event are applied (see Traveling and Road Events on p. 41 for details).

## Scenario Page

![Scenario page](img/rulebook/scenario-page.png)
- The name (a), reference number (b), and grid location (c) of the scenario with completion check box.
- Any achievements (d) required to play the scenario in a campaign.
- The victory conditions (e).
- When playing the scenario as part of a campaign, the page provides introductory text (f), additional story points (g) that are read when entering the corresponding hex on the board (h), and concluding text (i) to be read when the victory condition is met.
- The name, reference number, and grid location of any new scenario locations (j) unlocked by completing the scenario within a campaign.
- Any other rewards (k) earned by completing the scenario when in a campaign.

---
**<p align="right">Page 13</p>**

---

- Any locations the scenario links to ((l); see Traveling and Road Events on pp. 41–42 for details).
- The configuration of map tiles (m) and door tiles (n) to be placed during setup. The specific map tiles needed for each scenario are also given (o). Each scenario map is broken up into separate rooms by door overlay tiles. A room may contain more than one map tile if those tiles are connected by other overlay tiles.
- <img align="right" alt="Monster key" src="img/rulebook/monster-key.png"> Indications used to populate the scenario map based on the monster key . These indications may be in one of two different orientations depending on the overall orientation of the map. Monster placement is indicated in a symbol’s upper left for two characters, upper right for three characters and bottom for four characters. **BLACK** means the monster is not present, **WHITE** means a normal monster is present, and **GOLD** means an elite monster is present. Normal monsters should be placed on the map with their corresponding standees in white bases, and elite monsters should be placed in gold bases. Example: / indicates which type of monster is placed on this hex, and in this case no monster is placed in for two characters, a normal monster is placed for three characters, and an elite monster is placed for four characters. 

  ***Example:** ![Monster key example](img/misc/monster-key-example.png) indicates which type of monster is placed on this hex, and in this case no monster is placed in for two characters, a normal monster is placed for three characters, and an elite monster is placed for four characters.*

  **Note that only monsters in the starting room are placed at the beginning of a scenario. Monster standees each have a number to determine the order in which they act during the turn (see Order of Action on p. 29 for details). The standee numbers should be randomized when placed.**
  
- The available starting character locations, depicted by ![Starting location](img/icons/general/starting-location.png) (r) . Players can choose to place their figures on any empty ![Starting location](img/icons/general/starting-location.png) hex at the start of the scenario.
- The type of traps used in this scenario (s) and the reward for looting any treasure tiles on the board (t). The numbers for the treasures are referenced in the back of the Scenario Book, so that rewards are kept secret.
- Locations of money tokens (u) and overlay tiles (v) to be placed on the map when the room tile is revealed.

---
**<p align="right">Page 14</p>**

---

## Overlay Tiles

A scenario is constructed from a set of map tiles as instructed in the Scenario Book. Additionally, there will be special overlay tiles to fill out the encounter.

### TYPES OF OVERLAY TILES:

- **Doors** ![Door colour](img/misc/colour-door.png). A door acts as a separation between two rooms. When a character moves onto a closed door tile, they immediately flip over the door tile to the open side, revealing the adjacent room tile. Immediately place overlay tiles, monsters, and money tokens as indicated in the scenario description for the revealed room. While closed doors do not hinder character movement at all, they act as a wall for any monsters or character-summoned figures, and figures cannot be forced through a closed door. Open doors do not hinder any movement and cannot be closed. Door art varies by environment type, but they all function exactly the same.
- **Corridors** ![Corridor colour](img/misc/colour-corridor.png). A corridor is placed on the connection of two map tiles to cover the walls and create a single room out of multiple map tiles. Corridors act like normal empty hexes.
- **Traps** ![Trap colour](img/misc/colour-trap.png). A trap is sprung when a figure enters its hex with normal or forced movement. Flying ![Flying](img/icons/general/flying.png) and Jump ![Jump](img/icons/general/jump.png) movements are unaffected by traps. When a trap is sprung, it inflicts some negative effect on the figure who sprung it and then it is **removed from the board**. A trap can also be disarmed through specific actions to remove it from the board without suffering its negative effects. Trap effects are varied and are specified in the Scenario Book. If part of a trap’s effect is listed as “damage,” the trap will inflict **2+L damage** on the affected figure, where L is the **scenario level**. Characters and monsters can also create traps on the board, with the effects specified by the ability that creates the trap. Whenever a trap is placed on the board, tokens for the damage and effects the trap applies should be placed on top of the trap tile for easy reference.
- **Hazardous terrain** ![Harzardous terrain colour](img/misc/colour-hazardous.png). If a figure enters a hex with hazardous terrain via normal or forced movement, each hex will inflict half the damage of a trap (rounded down). Flying ![Flying](img/icons/general/flying.png) and Jump ![Jump](img/icons/general/jump.png) movements are unaffected by hazardous terrain. Unlike traps, hazardous terrain does not get removed after its effect is applied, but instead remains on the board indefinitely. Starting a turn on or exiting these hexes does not cause additional damage.
- **Difficult terrain** ![Difficult terrain colour](img/misc/colour-difficult.png). It takes a figure two normal movement points to enter a hex with difficult terrain. Flying ![Flying](img/icons/general/flying.png), Jump ![Jump](img/icons/general/jump.png), and forced movements are unaffected by difficult terrain.
- **Obstacles** ![Obstacles colour](img/misc/colour-obstacle.png). Obstacles have varying artwork, but they all have the same function: figures cannot move through obstacles with a normal movement, but can move through them with a Flying ![Flying](img/icons/general/flying.png) or Jump ![Jump](img/icons/general/jump.png) movement. **Obstacles do not hinder ranged attacks.** It is possible for certain character abilities to create or move obstacles. When doing so, players can never completely cut off one area of the scenario map from another, such that the area cannot be moved into without going through the obstacles.

---
**<p align="right">Page 15</p>**

---

- **Treasure** ![Treasure colour](img/misc/colour-treasure.png). Treasure tiles can be looted by a player (see Loot on p. 27 for details) for a variety of effects. There are two types of treasure tiles: “goal” tiles and numbered tiles. Goal tiles are important for the completion of a scenario, and the rules for looting them will be specified by the scenario. “Goal” tiles are reset every time a scenario is played. Numbered tiles can provide a number of different benefits. When one is looted, the looting player should immediately reference the number of the tile with the treasure index in the back of the scenario book to discover what was looted. If a **specific item name** is listed, find this item in the deck of unique items and immediately add it to your pool of items. If an **item design** is listed, find all copies of that item and add them to the city’s available supply. **Numbered treasure tiles can only be looted once.** After they have been looted, they should be crossed off in the Scenario Book as a reminder.

## Scenario Level

**Monster base statistics**, **trap damage**, the **amount of gold received from money tokens**, and the **amount of bonus experience for completing a scenario** are all dependent on the level of the scenario being played. The **scenario level** is chosen by the players before the scenario begins and is based on the average level of the party and how difficult the players want the scenario to be.

A scenario’s level can be set to any number from 0 to 7, but cannot be changed once the scenario begins. The **recommended** scenario level is equal to the average level of the characters in the party, divided by 2 and rounded up; this would be considered “Normal” difficulty. If players desire an “Easy” experience, they can reduce the recommended scenario level by 1. If a more difficult experience is desired, the scenario level can be raised by 1 for “Hard” or 2 for “Very Hard.”

Difficulty | Level modification
-----------|-------------------
Easy       | -1
Normal     | +0
Hard       | +1
Very Hard  | +2

Scenario level | Monster level | Gold conversion | Trap damage | Bonus experience
---------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------
0|0|2|2|4
1|1|2|3|6
2|2|3|4|8
3|3|3|5|10
4|4|4|6|12
5|5|4|7|14
6|6|5|8|16
7|7|6|9|18

***Example**: If a party contains a Level 6 character, two Level 4 characters, and a Level 3 character, the average would be 4.25; divided by 2 and rounded up is 3, so a normal scenario difficulty level would be 3. The choice of scenario level is completely up to the players. Higher scenario levels will result in more difficult monsters, but will also yield more gold and experience.*

**<p align="right">Page 16</p>**

## Game Variant: Open Information and Solo Play

A single player can play the game as a solo experience by controlling two or more characters at once. Part of the game’s difficulty, however, comes from not knowing exactly what the other characters will be doing on their turn. Because a solo player has precise information about what each character is doing and can coordinate more effectively, the game becomes easier. To compensate for this, solo players should **increase the monster level and trap damage by 1 for any given scenario without increasing gold conversion and bonus experience.**

Scenario level | Monster level | Gold conversion | Trap damage | Bonus experience
---------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------
0|1|2|3|4
1|2|2|4|6
2|3|3|5|8
3|4|3|6|10
4|5|4|7|12
5|6|4|8|14
6|7|5|9|16

Additionally, if they wish, a group of players may also play with fully open information by increasing the difficulty in the same way as for solo play. Playing with open information means that players can share the exact contents of their hands and discuss specific details about what they plan on doing. **This is not the recommended way to play the game**, but it may be desirable for certain groups.

# Round Overview

A scenario consists of a series of **rounds** that are played until players either meet the victory conditions of the scenario or fail the scenario. A round consists of the following steps:

1. **Card selection:** Each player will either select two cards from his or her hand to play or declare he or she is performing a **long rest action** for the round.
2. **Determining initiative:** Players reveal their cards for the round, and an ability card for each monster type currently in play is also revealed. An initiative order is then determined based on the initiative values of these revealed cards.
3. **Character and monster turns:** Starting with the lowest initiative, players and monsters will act out their **turns**, performing the actions on their cards, possibly modified by character item cards.
4. **Cleanup:** Some cleanup may be required at the end of the round (see End of Round on p. 32 for details).

## Card Selection

At the beginning of a round, each player will secretly select two cards from his or her hand to play facedown in front of them. Of the two cards, one should be selected as the **leading card**, which will determine the player’s order in the initiative for the round (see Determining Initiative on p. 18 for details).

---
**<p align="right">Page 17</p>**

---

Players should not show other players the cards in their hands nor give specific information about **any numerical value or title** on any of their cards. They are, however, allowed to make general statements about their actions for the round and discuss strategy. 
- **Examples of appropriate communication:** “I’m attacking this guard near the middle of the round.”; “I’m planning on moving here and healing you pretty early in the round, hopefully before the monsters attack.” 
- **Examples of inappropriate communication:** “You’ll need lower than an initiative 17 to go before me.”; “I should be doing 4 points of damage to the bandit, so you don’t have to worry about him.”; “I’m going to use Impaling Eruption and wipe out everyone.”

During a player’s turn, the two played cards will be used to perform actions and then are either **discarded**, **lost**, or **activated**, depending on the actions that were taken. Played cards are normally placed in a player’s **discard pile** unless otherwise noted. **Discarded** cards can be returned to a player’s **hand** through **resting** (see below). If the performed action from a card contains a ![Loss](img/icons/general/loss.png) symbol in the lower right of the action field, the card is instead placed in a player’s **lost pile**. Lost cards can only be returned to a player’s hand during a scenario by using a special **recover** action. Whether the corresponding card is lost or discarded, some actions may contain an **active** effect (denoted by the symbols at right). Instead of being placed in the discard or lost pile, the card is placed in the **active area** in front of the player to keep track of the effect. Once the effect wears off, the card is then transferred to the appropriate pile (see Active Bonuses on pp. 25–26 for details).

![Lost](img/icons/general/large/loss.png) | ![Recover](img/icons/general/large/recover.png) | ![Persistent Bonus](img/icons/general/large/persistent-bonus.png) | ![Round Bonus](img/icons/general/large/round-bonus.png)
-----|------|------|----------
Lost | Recover | Persistent Bonus (Active Effect) | Round Bonus (Active Effect)

Players **must** either play two cards from their hand or declare a **long rest action** at the beginning of **every** round. If a player only has one card or no cards in their hand, the long rest action is their only option. If this option is **also** not available at the beginning of a round because a player has only one card or no cards in their discard pile as well, that player is considered **exhausted** and can no longer participate in the scenario (see Exhaustion on p. 28 for details).

### RESTING

Resting is the main way players can return discarded cards back into their hand of available cards. A player has two options when resting: a **short rest** or a **long rest**. In both cases, the rest action can -**only** be taken if a player has two or more cards in his or her discard pile, and a rest action **always** results in losing one of the discarded cards.

- **Short rest:** During the cleanup step of a round, a player can perform a short rest. This allows that player to immediately shuffle his or her discard pile and **randomly** place one of the cards in the lost pile, then return the rest of the discarded cards to his or her hand. If the player would like to instead **keep** the card that was randomly lost, he or she can choose to suffer 1 damage and **randomly** lose a **different** discarded card, but this can only be done once per rest.
- **Long rest:** A long rest is declared during the card selection step of a round and constitutes the player’s entire turn for the round. Resting players are considered to have an initiative value of 99. On the player’s turn, at the end of the initiative order, he or she must **choose** to lose one of his or her discarded cards, then return the rest of the discarded cards to his or her hand. The resting character also **performs a “Heal ![Heal](img/icons/general/heal.png) 2, Self” action and refreshes all of his or her spent item cards.**

## Determining Initiative

After players have either selected their two action cards or declared a long rest, the players reveal a monster ability card for each type of monster that has at least one figure currently on the map. In addition, each player not taking a long rest reveals his or her selected cards for the round, placing their **leading card** on top so that its initiative value is visible.

Initiative order is determined by comparing the initiative values on all played monster ability cards and all of the players’ leading cards. Whoever has the lowest initiative value takes their turn first, then the next highest, and so on until every figure on the board has acted. When a monster type takes an action, each monster of that type will perform the actions listed on their played ability card, starting with elites and then normal monsters in ascending standee order.

If there is ever a tie in initiative between players, consult the non-leading card of each player to break the tie. (If there is still a tie, players should decide among themselves who goes first.) If there is a tie between a player and a monster type, the player goes first. If there is a tie between two monster types, the players decide which goes first.

![Initiative example](img/rulebook/initiative-example.png)

***Example:** At the start of the round, the Brute decides that he wishes to play the two cards shown. He also decides he wants to go late in the round, so he choses the “61” as his leading card. If he had wanted to go early, he could have chosen the “15” as the leading card. The Scoundrel reveals a leading card with “86” initiative, and the played Living Bones and Bandit Archer monster ability cards have “45” and “32” initiative respectively. The Bandit Archers activate first, then all of the Living Bones, then the Brute, and finally the Scoundrel.*

## Character Turn

On a character’s turn, he or she will perform the **top** action of one of the two ability cards played and the **bottom** action of the other. The **leading card** designation used to determine initiative is **no longer significant**. Either card can be played first for its top or bottom action. When playing a card’s action, the abilities of the action must be done in the order written and can’t be interrupted by the action on the other card. As soon as the action of a card is completed, it is immediately placed in the appropriate area (discard pile, lost pile, or active area) before anything else happens. Players are typically free to choose not to perform any part of the action on their card, however, they **must** perform any part that will cause a negative effect (e.g., reduce hit points, lose cards, or cause a negative condition) on themselves or their allies. An **ally** is any figure that fights with a character. This term includes summoned figures, but does not include the character itself. Abilities cannot affect allies unless the card or rules specify otherwise.

![Basic actions](img/rulebook/basic-action.png)

Players can also use **any card they play** as an **“Attack 2”** action on the **top** half or a **“Move 2”** action on the **bottom**. If a card is used this way, it is always discarded, regardless of what is printed on the card. On their turn, before, during, or after performing their two actions, players can use any number of items they have equipped.

---
**<p align="right">Page 19</p>**

---

### MOVE

![Move](img/icons/general/move.png) A **“Move X”** ability allows a character to move **up to** X number of hexes on the map. Figures (characters and monsters) can move through allies, but cannot move through enemies or obstacles. Traps and other terrain effects of hexes must be resolved when a figure enters them with normal movement. A figure cannot end its movement in the same hex as another figure. Figures can **never** move through walls.

![Jump](img/icons/general/jump.png) Some Move abilities are specified as a “Jump.” **Move X (Jump)** allows the character to ignore all figures and terrain effects during their movement. However, the last hex of a jump is still considered a normal movement, and so must obey the normal movement rules above.

![Flying](img/icons/general/flying.png) Some figures may also have the **“Flying”** special trait. This allows figures to completely ignore any figures and terrain tiles during any part of their movement, including the last hex, except that they still must end their movement in an **unoccupied** hex (no figures present). This includes forced movement like PUSH or PULL. If a figure loses its Flying trait while occupying an obstacle hex, it takes damage as if it had sprung a damage trap and then moves immediately to the nearest **empty** hex (no figures, tokens, or overlay tiles of any kind present except corridors, pressure plates, and open doors).

#### REVEALING A ROOM

During any part of a character’s movement, if they enter a tile with a closed door, flip the door tile to the opened side and immediately reveal the adjacent room on the other side of the door. The Scenario Book will then specify what monsters, money tokens, and special overlay tiles should be placed in the revealed room, based on the number of characters (including exhausted characters). Note that, as in scenario setup, the standee numbers of the monsters in the new room should be randomized when placed. It is possible to run out of specific types of monster standees when revealing a room. If this happens, place only the standees that are available, starting with the monsters closest to the revealing character.

Once everything is placed in the new room, any present monster types without an action card should have one drawn for them now. Once the revealing character’s turn ends, the initiative values of all monsters in the new room are reviewed, and any monster type that has a lower initiative value than the revealing character (i.e., they should have acted earlier in the round) must immediately act out their turn (in normal initiative order in case of multiple monster types in this situation). This ensures that all monsters revealed in the new room will **always** take a turn in the round in which they are revealed.

### ATTACK

![Attack](img/icons/general/attack.png) An **“Attack X”** ability allows a character to do a base X amount of damage to an enemy within their range. Figures cannot attack their allies. There are two types of attacks: **ranged** and **melee**.

![Range](img/icons/general/range.png) **Ranged attacks** are accompanied by a **“Range Y”** value, which means any enemy within Y hexes can be targeted by the attack. Any ranged attack targeting an adjacent enemy gains Disadvantage against that target (see Advantage and Disadvantage on pp. 20–21 for details).

**Melee attacks** have no accompanying range value and are considered to have a default range of 1 hex, which means they typically target adjacent enemies.

**Line-of-sight:** All ranged and melee attacks can only be performed against enemies within line-of-sight, which means that a line can be drawn from any corner of the attacker’s hex to any corner of the defender’s hex without touching any part of a wall (the line edge of a map tile or the entire area of any partial hex along the edge of a map tile, unless covered by an overlay tile). Only walls block line-of-sight. In addition, **any ability** which specifies a range can only be performed on a figure within line-of-sight. If a non-attack ability does not specify a range, then line-of-sight is not required. Also note that two hexes separated by a wall line are not considered adjacent, and range cannot be counted through walls.

---
**<p align="right">Page 20</p>**

---

When attacking, the base attack value written on the card can be modified by three types of values in the following order. Repeat these steps for each individual enemy targeted by the attack: 

- An **attacker’s attack modifiers** are applied first. These modifiers include bonuses and penalties from active ability cards, items, and other sources (e.g., +1 Attack from POISON). 
- Next, an **attack modifier card** is drawn from the attacker’s attack modifier deck and applied. 
- Lastly, the **defender’s defensive bonuses** are applied. This reduces the incoming attack value for each individual enemy targeted based on each defender’s own shield modifier or other defensive bonuses. 
- If there are multiple modifiers in any single step of this process, the player chooses the order in which they are applied. Also note that because the bonuses are applied **per target**, it is possible for the same attack action to ultimately deal different damage to each enemy it targets.

***Example:** The Scoundrel performs an “Attack 3” ability on an adjacent elite Bandit Guard. The Scoundrel adds a +2 attack modifier because of specific conditions set by the card and also is allowed to double the attack because of an active card in front of her. She chooses to add the +2, then doubles the result, resulting in an “Attack 10.” She then plays an attack modifier card to reveal a “-1,” so the attack is reduced to 9. Finally, the Bandit Guard has a shield value of 1, so the attack value is reduced to 8 and the bandit suffers 8 damage.*

Any damage suffered by a monster should be tracked on the stat sleeve in the section corresponding to the number on the specific monster’s standee. When a monster is brought to zero or fewer hit points by an attack or any source of damage, that monster immediately dies and is removed from the board. Any additional effects of an attack are not applied once a monster dies.

**When a monster dies, a money token is also placed on the hex where it died if the monster was not summoned or spawned.**

#### ADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGE

Some attacks may have either **Advantage** or **Disadvantage**.

- ![Advantage](img/rulebook/advantage.png)
  
  An attacker with **Advantage** will draw two modifier cards from their deck and use whichever one is **better** (a). If one rolling modifier card was drawn, its effect is added to the other card played (b). If two rolling modifier cards were drawn, continue to draw cards until a rolling modifier is not drawn and then add together all drawn effects (c).
- ![Disadvantage](img/rulebook/disadvantage.png)

  An attacker with **Disadvantage** will draw two modifier cards from their deck and use whichever one is **worse** (d). Rolling modifiers are disregarded in the case of Disadvantage (e). If two rolling modifier cards were drawn, continue to draw cards until a rolling modifier is not played and then only apply the effect of the last card drawn (f).

---
**<p align="right">Page 21</p>**

---

If there is ambiguity about which card drawn is better or worse, use whichever card was drawn first. Ambiguity can occur when comparing one or more added effects provided by attack modifier cards (e.g., elemental infusions, negative conditions, etc.) All added effects should be considered to have a positive but undefined numerical value.

Instances of Advantage and Disadvantage are mostly gained by specific character or monster abilities. However, any ranged attack targeting an adjacent enemy also gains Disadvantage for that target. Instances of Advantage or Disadvantage don’t stack, and if an attack has instances of both Advantage and Disadvantage, they cancel out each other and the attack is performed normally.

#### AREA EFFECTS

Some attacks and other abilities allow figures to target multiple hexes or multiple targets at the same time. In these cases, the area of effect for the ability is shown on the ability card. **Note that any rotational orientation of the depicted diagram is valid. Also note that each target constitutes a separate *attack* (drawing its own attack modifier card), but all attacks together make up a single *attack action*.**

![Area of Effect: attacker](img/icons/general/aoe-attacker.png) Grey indicates the hex on which the figure is currently located. An area attack which includes a grey hex is always considered a melee attack.

![Area of Effect: target](img/icons/general/aoe-target.png) Red indicates the hexes with enemies affected by the ability.

For a ranged area attack, only one of the red hexes needs to be within the range specified, and it does not need to contain an enemy. However, for both ranged and melee area attacks, **you can only attack enemies in hexes you have line of sight to**.

![AoE example 1](img/rulebook/aoe-example-1.png) | ![AoE example 2](img/rulebook/aoe-example-2.png)
-|-
***Example:** This attack indicates that the figure can perform a ranged “Attack 4” on a cluster of three hexes as long as at least one of those hexes is within Range 3.* | ***Example:** This attack indicates that the figure can perform a melee “Attack 3” on the cluster of three hexes.*

![Target](img/icons/general/target.png) Some attacks are accompanied by a “Target X” value, which means the character can target X number of different enemies within the attack’s range with the attack.

For any attack that targets multiple enemies, an attack modifier card is drawn for **each target**. It is not possible to target the same enemy with multiple attacks from the same ability. **Note:** Abilities can **never** target allies (positive abilities meant for allies will use the term “affect” instead of “target”). An ally can be within the affected area of an attack, but **they will not be targeted by it.**

Note also that as long as an attack does not specify range, it is considered melee, such that it is possible to attack a non-adjacent target with a melee attack if hex configuration allows.

**<p align="right">Page 22</p>**

---

#### ATTACK EFFECTS

Attack abilities will often have effects that increase their power. If an attack effect is listed on an ability card after an attack, the target (or targets) of the attack is subject to the additional effect as well, after damage from the attack is resolved. **Attack effects are applied regardless of whether the corresponding attack does damage.** These effects (except experience gains) are optional and can be skipped. Some character actions can also apply these effects without an attack, and in such cases the target of the effect is written on the ability card.

![Push](img/icons/status/push.png) **PUSH X** – The target is forced to move X hexes in a direction specified by the attacker, but each hex moved must place the target **farther away from** the attacker than it was previously. If there are no viable hexes into which to push the target, the push ends. The target can be pushed through its allies, but not its enemies.

![Pull](img/icons/status/pull.png) **PULL X** – The target is forced to move X hexes in a direction specified by the attacker, but each hex moved must place the target **closer to** the attacker than it was previously. If there are no viable hexes into which to pull the target, the pull ends. The target can be pulled through its allies, but not its enemies. Both push and pull effects are considered movements, however, they are not affected by difficult terrain.

![Pierce](img/icons/status/pierce.png) **PIERCE X** – Up to X points of the target’s Shield are ignored for the attack. Unlike other effects, PIERCE is applied while calculating the accompanying attack damage instead of afterwards.

***Example:** an Attack 3 PIERCE 2 ability used on a monster with Shield 3 would ignore two of the monster’s Shield points and inflict 2 damage (modified by an attack modifier card).*

![Add Target](img/icons/status/add-target.png) **ADD TARGET** – If a figure triggers this effect with an attack action, the figure may add an additional target within range to their attack. All added effects and conditions of the attack action are applied to the target, as well, except for effects that would result in additional targets outside of the original added target (e.g., area attacks).

### CONDITIONS

Certain abilities may apply conditions to their targets. When a condition is applied to a figure (except CURSE and BLESS), the respective token is placed on the stat sleeve in the section corresponding the number on the specific monster’s standee to signify the effect. The condition remains on the figure until the requirements for removing the specific effect are met. Only one of each condition type may be applied to any single figure at a time, however conditions can be reapplied to refresh their duration.

The following are **negative conditions**. If an ability has the name of one of these conditions contained within it, then the condition is applied to all targets of the ability, after the main effect of the ability is applied. Conditions are applied regardless of whether the corresponding attack does damage.

![Poison](img/icons/status/poison.png) **POISON** – If a figure is poisoned, all enemies add +1 Attack to all of their attacks targeting the figure. If a Heal ability is used on a poisoned figure, the POISON token is removed, and the Heal has no other effect.

![Wound](img/icons/status/wound.png) **WOUND** – If a figure is wounded, it suffers one point of damage at the start of each of its turns. If a Heal ability is used on a wounded figure, the WOUND token is removed and the Heal continues normally. If a figure is both poisoned and wounded, a Heal ability would remove both conditions but have no other effect.

![Immobilize](img/icons/status/immobilize.png) **IMMOBILIZE** – If a figure is immobilized, it cannot perform any **move** abilities on its turn. At the end of its next turn, the IMMOBILIZE token is removed.

---
**<p align="right">Page 23</p>**

---

![Disarm](img/icons/status/disarm.png) **DISARM** – If a figure is disarmed, it cannot perform any **attack** abilities on its turn. At the end of its next turn, the DISARM token is removed.

![Stun](img/icons/status/stun.png) **STUN** – If a figure is stunned, it cannot perform **any** abilities or use items on its turn **except to perform a long rest** (in the case of characters). At the end of its next turn, the STUN token is removed. Players must still play two cards or rest on their turn, and if a player plays two cards while stunned, the actions played are not used, and the cards are simply discarded.

![Muddle](img/icons/status/muddle.png) **MUDDLE** – If a figure is muddled, it gains Disadvantage on all of its attacks. At the end of its next turn, the MUDDLE token is removed.

![Curse](img/icons/status/curse.png) **CURSE** – If a figure is cursed, it must shuffle a CURSE card into its remaining attack modifier deck. When this card is revealed through one of the figure’s attacks, it is removed from the deck instead of being placed into the attack modifier discard pile. Note that there are two separate curse decks: 10 cards with a ![Monster icon](img/misc/monster.png) in the lower left corner and 10 cards with an ![Star icon](img/misc/star.png). ![Monster icon](img/misc/monster.png) cards can only be placed in the monster attack deck (when a monster is cursed), and ![Star icon](img/misc/star.png) cards can only be placed in a character's attack deck (when a character or character summon is cursed). Thus, a maximum of only 10 curse cards can be placed into any one deck.

The following are **positive conditions**. Figures can apply positive conditions to themselves or allies through specific actions. Positive conditions cannot be prematurely removed.

![Invisible](img/icons/status/invisible.png) **INVISIBLE** – If a figure is invisible, it cannot be focused on or targeted by an enemy. Invisibility does not affect a figure’s interactions with his or her allies. At the end of its next turn, the INVISIBLE token is removed. Monsters treat invisible characters exactly as if they were obstacles.

![Strengthen](img/icons/status/strengthen.png) **STRENGTHEN** – If a figure is strengthened, it gains Advantage on all of its attacks. At the end of its next turn, the STRENGTHEN token is removed.

![Bless](img/icons/status/bless.png) **BLESS** – If a figure is blessed, it must shuffle a BLESS card into its remaining attack modifier deck. When this card is revealed through one of the figure’s attacks, it is removed from the deck instead of being placed into the attack modifier discard pile.

### ELEMENTAL INFUSIONS

![Elemental infusion](img/rulebook/elemental-infusion.png)

Some abilities have an elemental affinity associated with them (either **Fire**, **Ice**, **Air**, **Earth**, **Light**, or **Dark**). If any of these symbols is visible by itself in an action’s description (a), it means that by performing any part of the action, the figure must infuse the battlefield with that element. This is represented by moving the corresponding element’s token to the “Strong” column of the elemental infusion table **at the end of the turn** in which the ability was used.

---
**<p align="right">Page 24</p>**

---

![Elemental waning](img/rulebook/elemental-waning.png)

At the end of every round, however, all elemental infusions will wane, moving **one step** to the left in the table, from “Strong” to “Waning” **or** from “Waning” to “Inert.”

![Elemental consumption](img/rulebook/elemental-consumption.png)

Elemental infusions can be used to augment the effects of certain abilities. This augment is represented by an elemental symbol covered with a red ![Consume element](img/icons/elements/consume.png) (b), followed by a colon and how the ability is augmented if the element is consumed. If an ability is used that consumes an element and the corresponding element token is in the Strong or Waning column, that element token **may** be used to augment the ability by moving the token to the Inert column. A single icon cannot be used to consume more than one infusion, and **it is not possible to create an element and consume it on the same turn**, but it may be consumed by anyone with a later turn in the initiative order of the same round.

If an ability contains multiple separate augments, the player may choose which augments to use in any order. If a single augment lists multiple element uses, all elements must be used to activate the augment.

Just like characters, monsters also have the ability to create and consume elements. Monsters always consume elements if they can, and every activated monster of that type will gain the benefit of the consumed element, not just the first monster to consume it.

![Any element](img/icons/elements/any.png) This multi-colored circle represents **any single one** of the six elements. If this symbol is present on a monster’s ability card, the players choose which element is created or consumed.

![Fire](img/icons/elements/large/fire.png) | ![Ice](img/icons/elements/large/ice.png) | ![Air](img/icons/elements/large/air.png) | ![Earth](img/icons/elements/large/earth.png) | ![Light](img/icons/elements/large/light.png) | ![Dark](img/icons/elements/large/dark.png)
-----|------|------|----------|-----------|-----------
Fire | Ice | Air | Earth | Light | Dark

### ACTIVE BONUSES

Some abilities can give a character, or his or her allies, bonuses on other abilities, either **persistently** until certain conditions are fulfilled **or** for the rest of the **round**. These abilities are denoted with symbols, and the cards with these effects are played into the **active area** in front of the player to keep track of these bonuses.

**Persistent bonuses** can be identified by the symbol ![Persistent bonus](img/icons/general/persistent-bonus.png) displayed on the card. These ability effects will be active from the time the card is played until the conditions specified on the card are met. These conditions usually track the number of times a particular game event has occurred, such as making or defending against an attack. Place a token on the first marked position of the card’s action and advance it one space each time the effect is triggered, left to right, top to bottom. When the ability has been used once for each space on the card, remove the card from play by placing it in the lost pile. Players **must** use the benefits of a persistent bonus when possible, even if no benefit is gained. If there are no conditions specified or positions marked, the card may remain in the player’s active area for the rest of the scenario and can be removed from play at any time by placing it in the lost pile.

![Persistent bonus example](img/rulebook/persistent-bonus-example.png)

***Example**: The Spellweaver plays her Frost Armor ability, which negates the next two sources of damage against her. She places a character token on the first circle of the card (a). Then each time afterward that she normally would suffer 1 or more points of damage, the bonus is applied, the damage is negated, and the token is moved forward one space. Once the token moves twice, the card is moved to the player’s lost pile and the bonus is no longer active.***

![Character tokens](img/rulebook/character-tokens.png)  
*Examples of Character Tokens*

**Round bonuses** will have this symbol ![Round bonus](img/icons/general/round-bonus.png) on the card. The effect of the ability will be active from the time the card is played until the end of the round, at which point the card will be placed in the player’s discard or lost pile (depending on whether the action also contains an ![Loss](img/icons/general/loss.png) symbol).

Even though a bonus card is placed in the active area, it is still considered **discarded** or **lost**, depending on whether the action also contains an ![Loss](img/icons/general/loss.png) symbol. At any time, these cards can be moved to the appropriate pile, however, doing so immediately removes any bonuses that were being applied by the card.

#### SHIELD

![Shield](img/icons/general/shield.png) A “Shield X” bonus ability gives the recipient a defender’s bonus that reduces any incoming attack value by X. Multiple shield bonuses stack with one another and can be applied in any order. **A shield bonus only applies to damage caused by an attack.**

---
**<p align="right">Page 26</p>**

---

#### RETALIATE

![Retaliate](img/icons/general/retaliate.png) A “Retaliate X” bonus ability causes the recipient to inflict X points of damage on figures who attack it from an adjacent hex for each attack made. A retaliate bonus can also be accompanied by a “Range Y” value, which means that the retaliate damage is applied to any attacker within Y hexes. A retaliate takes effect after the attack that initiated it. If the retaliating figure is killed or exhausted by the attack, then the retaliate does not activate. Multiple retaliate bonuses stack with one another, and retaliate itself is not an attack or even a targeted effect.

### HEAL

![Heal](img/icons/general/heal.png) A “Heal X” ability allows a figure to return X hit points to either themselves or one ally within the ability’s range. Heals are always accompanied by one of two labels: 

- **“Range Y”** means that any ally within Y hexes, or the figure performing the heal, can be affected by the heal. Like all ranged abilities, the recipient must be in line-of-sight. 
- **“Self”** mean the figure can only affect him or herself with the heal.

### SUMMON

Some abilities summon other ally figures to the board. Summoned figures (summons) are placed in an empty hex adjacent to the figure performing the summon. If there are no available hexes, the summon ability cannot be used. Summons are represented by a colored summon token. There are eight different colors of summon tokens so that multiple summons can be tracked at the same time, and players can assign any color they like to a specific summon, placing tracker tokens on their summon ability cards for easy reference.

Summons have basic statistics for hit points, attack value, move value, and range value along with any special traits written on the ability card. A summon is considered a persistent bonus (the card is placed in the active area) until either the summon loses all its hit points, its corresponding ability card is removed from the active area, or the summoner becomes exhausted, at which point the summon is removed from the board.

A summon’s turn in the initiative order is always **directly before the character who summoned it**, and is separate from that character’s turn. Summons are not controlled by the summoning player, but instead obey automated monster rules, permanently following the ability card **“Move+0, Attack+0”** (see Monster Turn on pp. 29–32 for details) and using the player’s attack modifier deck to perform its attacks.

A player can have multiple different summon abilities in play at once, in which case they act in the order in which they were summoned. Summoned figures **never** take a turn in the round they are summoned. Summon kills are credited to the owner of the summon.

**<p align="right">Page 27</p>**

---

### RECOVER AND REFRESH

Certain abilities allow a player to **recover** discarded or lost **ability** cards. This means that the player can look through his or her discard or lost pile (or discarded or lost cards in his or her active area), select up to a number of cards specified in the ability, and immediately return them to his or her hand. Some cards, however, **cannot be recovered or refreshed once lost**. This is denoted by the ![Unrecoverable](img/icons/general/unrecoverable.png) symbol. This symbol applies to the card no matter how the card was lost or consumed.

**Refresh** abilities allow players to regain the use of spent or consumed **item** cards.

In the case of both recover and refresh, the type of card gained (discarded or lost for ability cards, spent or consumed for item cards) is specified in the ability.

![Recover](img/icons/general/large/recover.png) | ![Refresh](img/icons/general/large/refresh.png) | ![Unrecoverable](img/icons/general/large/unrecoverable.png)
-----|------|------
Recover Ability Card | Refresh Item | Cannot be recovered or refreshed once lost or consumed

### LOOT

![Loot](img/icons/general/loot.png) A “Loot X” ability allows a character to pick up every money token and treasure tile within range X. This action is unaffected by the positions of monsters or obstacles, but note this is considered a ranged ability for the purposes of line-of-sight. Money tokens are kept in a player’s personal supply and are not shared with the other players. If a treasure tile is looted, immediately refer to the reference number in the treasure index in the back of the scenario book to determine what is found (see Treasure on p. 15 for details). If a character loots an item he or she already owns a copy of, the new item is immediately sold to the city’s available supply (see Buying and Selling Items on p. 43 for details).

#### END-OF-TURN-LOOTING

In addition to specific loot abilities, **a character must also loot any money tokens or treasure tiles present in the hex he or she occupies at the end of the character’s turn**. Character summons do not perform end-of-turn looting.

### GAINING EXPERIENCE

![Experience](img/rulebook/experience.png)

Some actions also have an experience value attached to them, denoted by ![XP](img/icons/general/xp.png). When that action is taken, the character gains the number of experience specified. An ability card cannot be played for the experience alone—a character must use one or more of the accompanying abilities to earn the experience. In addition, sometimes the action specifies that experience is only earned under certain conditions, such as consuming an elemental infusion or if the attacked target is adjacent to an attacker’s allies (a). Some persistent bonuses will also give a character experience, denoted by ![XP charge](img/icons/general/charge-xp.png), when that charge of the bonus is expended (b) (i.e., when the character token moves off that slot). **Characters do not automatically gain experience from killing monsters. Only using specific actions awards experience.**

---
**<p align="right">Page 28</p>**

---

![Tracking dial](img/rulebook/tracking-dial.png)

Experience is tracked on the right side of a player’s tracking dial by rotating the wheel to the appropriate number (c).

### CHARACTER DAMAGE

Whenever any **damage** is dealt to a character, the player has two options:

- **Suffer the damage** and **move his or her hit point total on the tracking wheel down the appropriate number**, or…
- **Choose one card to lose** from his or her **hand** or **two cards to lose** from his or her **discard pile** to negate the damage (any additional effects of the attack are still applied). **Note** that before a character acts in a round, the two cards chosen at the beginning of the round are neither in the player’s hand or lost or discard pile, and so cannot be lost to negate damage.

Whenever a character is healed, move his or her **hit point total on the tracking wheel up the appropriate number** (d). The tracking wheel cannot go above the character's maximum hit point value indicated on the player’s character mat (e).

### EXHAUSTION

A character can become **exhausted** in one of two ways: 

- If a character ever drops below one hit point on the hit point tracker, or… 
- If, at the beginning of a round, a player cannot play two cards from his or her hand (because they have one card or no cards in his or her hand) and also cannot rest (because they have one card or no cards in their discard pile). Exhaustion due to insufficient cards does not affect a character’s current hit point total.
- 
- In either case, all ability cards are placed in the characters lost pile, the character’s figure is removed from the map, and the character can no longer participate in the scenario in any way. **There is no coming back from being exhausted during a scenario**, and thus it should be avoided at all costs. If **all** characters become exhausted during a scenario, the scenario is lost.

### ITEMS

Characters can use items at any time, within the constraints of what is written on the item card, including in the middle of a card ability. However, if an item affects an attack (e.g. adds a bonus, an effect, advantage, or disadvantage), it has to be used before an attack modifier is drawn. If an effect is added to an attack, it functions exactly as if it had been written on the action card being used for the attack. There is no limit to the number of items a character can use on their turn or even during a specific ability. Any instance of applying the effects of an item card to a situation is considered a use. Like persistent abilities, an item with multiple use circles **must** be used when the situation applies.

## Monster Turn

Monsters’ decisions are controlled by a system of action cards that **automate** what the monsters will do on their turn in the initiative order. They are **not** controlled by a separate player. All monsters will perform the actions listed on their ability card for the round in the order written. **They will not move or attack unless these actions are listed on their card.**

Note that each type of monster can come in two ranks: **normal** and **elite**. Normal monsters are designated with a white stand and elite monsters are designated with a gold stand. When an elite monster acts, use the statistics in the “Elite” section of the monster statistic card.

### ORDER OF ACTION

![Monster standee and stat card](img/rulebook/monster-standee.png)

All monsters of the same type take individual turns at the same initiative value listed on their monster ability card. **All elites of a type activate first, then the normal monsters of that type activate.** If more than one elite or normal monster of a given type is present on the board, then the monsters activate in ascending numerical order according to the numbers on their tokens (a).

*In addition to determining order of action, the number on the monster standee (a) corresponds to a section of the monster stat sleeve (b) that can be used to track damage and condition tokens.*

![Monster initiative example](img/rulebook/monster-initiative-example.png)

***Example:** With the setup to the left, the elite monster to the right (2) will activate first, then the other elite (3). Next the normal monster on the top will activate (1), then the lower monster (4). Even though (1) is lower in numerical order than (2) and (3), (2) and (3) are elite, so they activate first.*

### MONSTER FOCUS

Before performing any action on their ability card, each individual monster will focus on a specific enemy—either a character or character summon.

- A monster will focus on the enemy figure it can perform its current attack against using the least amount of movement. It finds the shortest possible path to get in range and line-of-sight to use its attack, and the figure that can be attacked at the end of that path is the focus. This enemy figure is considered the “closest.” It doesn’t matter if the monster can’t get within range to attack with its current movement, as long as there is a path to eventually get within range. If a monster does not have an attack listed on its ability card for the round, it finds a focus as if it had a melee attack. In the case where the monster can move the same number of spaces to get within range (and line-of-sight) of multiple enemy figures (e.g., because it starts its turn within range of multiple enemies), proximity from the monster’s current position (i.e. number of hexes they are away, not counting through walls) is then checked as a tie-breaker for determining “closest.”
